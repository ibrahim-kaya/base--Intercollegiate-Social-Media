# base - Intercollegiate Social Media

It is a social media platform where you can write what is happening at your university, what you want to share or what you are curious about, on your university wall, and at the same time you can follow what is happening in each university.

I made this website years ago and learned PHP by developing this site. It's my first project. So it's normal for it to be a bit amateurish :)

I keep it and share it because it has sentimental value in me :)

## Features

- You can write on the pages of universities.
- You can comment on other people's posts.
- Classic notification system like facebook or twitter when someone interacts you.
- You can edit your profile details.
- A section on the left side on homepage which is lists most active universities.

  ( Nice features for a beginner I think :) )
